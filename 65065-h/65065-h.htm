<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Come</span>, sing ye, Jimmy Riley, from your ancient lyric stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder’s in the shock,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we’ll let the bounding echoes catch the lyric in your lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it darts around the bases to the outfield and away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there’s music in its make-up and there’s rhythm in its run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a touch of “back to nature” in its sentiment of fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in some way it has struck us that the theme is out of date,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a new age comes a-whizzing and a-curving by the plate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we’ll start another chorus as the echoes rise and fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When the bat is on the bingle and the bug is on the bawl.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, sing ye, Jimmy Riley, and we’ll listen to your strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we find our thoughts a-straying from the waving of the grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the waving of the bludgeons as the batters draw ’em back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they wave against the trade-mark with a wallop and a whack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And “the swimmin’ hole” is faded, with its one-time tender pull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the “hole” the pitcher’s got in with the bloomin’ bases full;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while, whatever happens, we will never have a knock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the “frost upon the pumpkin and the fodder in the shock,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a later theme that draws us where the echoes rise and fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bat is on the bingle and the bug is on the bawl.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So come ye, Jimmy Riley, with a later song to sing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When the fan is on the frolic and the wallop on the wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the swing is on the spitter and the swipe is on the swat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bum is on the bobble and he boots one round the lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the break is on the bender and the squad is on the slump,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the flag is on the flutter and the brick is on the ump.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belay that ancient chatter of the “fodder, frost, and shock”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rooter’s on the rampage and the knocker’s on the knock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a later theme has drawn us where the echoes rise and fall&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">There</span> were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were muttered oaths and curses&mdash;every fan in town was sore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Just think,” said one, “how soft it looked with Casey at the bat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then to think he’d go and spring a bush league trick like that!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All his past fame was forgotten&mdash;he was now a hopeless “shine.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They called him “Strike-Out Casey,” from the mayor down the line;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey’s eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He pondered in the days gone by that he had been their king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when he strolled up to the plate they made the welkin ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now his nerve had vanished, for when he heard them hoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He “fanned” or “popped out” daily, like some minor league recruit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He soon began to sulk and loaf, his batting eye went lame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No home runs on the score card now were chalked against his name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fans without exception gave the manager no peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one and all kept clamoring for Casey’s quick release.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Mudville squad began to slump, the team was in the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their playing went from bad to worse&mdash;nobody seemed to care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Back to the woods with Casey!” was the cry from Rooters’ Row.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Get some one who can hit the ball, and let that big dub go!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lane is long, some one has said, that never turns again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Casey smiled; his rugged face no longer wore a frown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All Mudville had assembled&mdash;ten thousand fans had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he stepped into the box, the multitude went wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He doffed his cap in proud disdain, but Casey only smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Play ball!” the umpire’s voice rang out, and then the game began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought that Mudville had a chance, and with the setting sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hopes sank low&mdash;the rival team was leading “four to one.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the first man up hit safe, the crowd began to roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the pitcher hit the second and gave “four balls” to the third.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three men on base&mdash;nobody out&mdash;three runs to tie the game!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville’s hall of fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the fourth one “fouled to catcher” and the fifth “flew out to right.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A dismal groan in chorus came; a scowl was on each face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed, his teeth were clenched in hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But fame is fleeting as the wind and glory fades away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored: “Strike him out!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard this shout.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The pitcher smiled and cut one loose&mdash;across the plate it sped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another hiss, another groan. “Strike one!” the umpire said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zip! Like a shot the second curve broke just below the knee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Strike two!” the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No roasting for the umpire now&mdash;his was an easy lot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the pitcher whirled again&mdash;was that a rifle shot?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A whack, a crack, and out through the space the leather pellet flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above the fence in center field in rapid whirling flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sphere sailed on&mdash;the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Mudville hearts are happy now, <i>for Casey hit the ball</i>.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A man who didn’t hit above .500 couldn’t stick<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While in the act of pullin’ down the longest, hardest flies;<br /></span>

<span class="dtts">. . . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span class="i0">That night we wired Anson to discover if he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man by name of Casey, as we felt we ought to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the answer came next day it stirred up quite a fuss:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We hunted for him quite a spell, but he had gone away,<br /></span>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
